    <!--
        In the markup below, a template named "hello" is
        defined. This template has two fields: id and message.

        In the file

        app/src/app/clj/html_templates.clj

        this template can be extracted by calling

        (def template-fn (tfn (tnodes "app.clj.html" "hello")))

        template-fn is a function which, when called with a map of
        values, will return a string of HTML with filled-in values.

        (template-fn {:id 42 :message "Hello"})

        The field attribute takes a comma delimited list of

        html-element-attribute-name:map-key

        content is a special case which means that the content
        (innerHTML) of the element will be set to this value.
